1) Please discuss the problem of weight initialization in a neural network. How to tackle it. Discuss both intuition and maths from scratch.

2) Please discuss the problem of vanishing & exploding gradient descent in a neural network. How to tackle it. Discuss both intuition and maths from scratch.

3) How parallel computing works in mini-batch? Or does it work?

4) What is the difference between multilabel classification and multiclassClassification? (Read the cost functions thoroughly)

5) Understand the computation of gradients in backprop for logistic.

6) What is a neural network? How to explain it to a professional + How to explain it to a layman?

7) Next need to study on Adam.. How is it coming....
